# FormulaParser
library for calculator for numbers with units

## Description
This is a library to calculate with units.
To make calculation, give `Parser` object a string valued numerical expression and call `compile()` function.
You will get `Expression` object and that's `evaluate()` Function will return the result by string.

## Usage
At this time, you have to `clone` this repository to your local and make Jar or something.

## Test
At this time, there are no tests. This is terrible. I do will make it better.

## Design
I used Recursive Descent Parsing.
