library for calculator for numbers with units

## Description
Now, it become a Kotlin with Gradle project!ðŸŽ‰

This is a library to calculate with units.
To make calculation, give `Parser` object a string valued numerical expression and call `compile()` function.
You will get `Expression` object and that's `evaluate()` Function will return the result by string.

## Usage
At this time, you have to `clone` this repository to your local and make Jar or something.

## Test
I'm working hard.
I added code coverage for controlling test.

## Design
I used Recursive Descent Parsing.
